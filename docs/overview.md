## Problem
When developing smart-contracts for the blochain, it's extremly important to deploy only save smart-contracts, 
because any harm, caused to the network can not be reverted or fixed. So, developers need an instrument of smart-contract verification,
and users need an instance, that guarantees them the smart-contract safety. 
Our project is intended to serve this two goals.
